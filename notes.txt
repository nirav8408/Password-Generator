useCallback memoizes a function — meaning it remembers the same function between re-renders unless dependencies change.

This ensures passwordGenerator only changes when:
length
numberAllowed
charAllowed
...change.

If these don’t change, the function stays the same.

means it runs passwordgenerator when changes occur like lenght char allowed number allowed etc


useEffect 

it runs passwordgenerator when changes occur



useCallback ensures passwordGenerator isn’t recreated on every render.

useEffect runs passwordGenerator() whenever the settings (length, options) change.
